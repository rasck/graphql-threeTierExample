Uses:
Next (https://zeit.co/blog/next) -> Does a lot of stuff for us, such as transpiling, building, hot-reloading, running a server, uses our file structure as api. Don't know if it should be used for production, but fast for prototyping...
React (https://facebook.github.io/react/) -> A view library
Apollo (http://dev.apollodata.com/) -> A library to connect our client to the graphql server

Note: backend and middletier should be running before running frontend

How to run:
- npm install
- npm run dev
